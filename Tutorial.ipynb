    "\n",
    "1) find lenses\n",
    "2) compute the $\\alpha$ map\n",
    "3) study their density\n",

    "# Very small intermezzo on hydrosimulations\n",
    "You probably know as well as me, if not better, what an hydrodynamical simulation (henceforth hydrosim) is. However, just to be sure we all on the same page, I will recap here some very basic but necessary informations.\n",
    "Hydrosims are composed of particles, divided in 4 classes:\n",
    "1) **dark matter**\n",
    "2) **gas**\n",
    "3) **stars**\n",
    "4) **black holes**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They mainly interact gravitationally, but being hydro (and not n-body) simulations, they also have peculiar and individual properties: star-formation, feedbacks, accretion etc. For what concerns lensing, however, we luckily can ignore all this and just treat them as massive particles for our lenses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the simulations evolve in time (thus in redshifts z), and its properties are then stored at given **snapshots (snap**) in time. Thus **z $\\leftrightarrow$ snap**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these, the galaxy catalogues have been compiled (luckily!), thus finding the formed galaxies and linking the particle to a given galaxy, which in turn is charaterised by Mass and its redshift, properties we can select for.\n",
